                      <p>A Drought-Free and Prosperous Maharashtra</p>
                      <br>
                      <p> For decades, drought has ravaged thousands of villages in Maharashtra,
                        leading to thirst, hunger, debt, forced migration and withered crops. After
                        travelling through hundreds of villages, and speaking with veterans in the
                        field, we discovered that this crisis is largely man-made. It is a result of
                        mismanagement of water and natural resources, exacerbated by the
                        uncertainties caused by climate change.
                        The scientific solutions to eradicating this crisis can be found in methods of
                        water conservation, water management and environment restoration. These
                        are well-known solutions, propagated by experts for years.
