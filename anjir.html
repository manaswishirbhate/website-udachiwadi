                <p>Anjir trees prefer a warm and dry climate
                    with temperatures between 15 degree C & 40 degree C.They can
                    tolerate temperature as high as 45 degree C , but the quality of fruit
                    deteriorates above 39 degree C.Anjir trees are sentestive to first and
                    can be damaged by freezing Temperatures.
                    Well-draining soil rich in organic matter is essential for anjir
                    trees.Consider enriching soil with well-rotted manure or compost to
                    provide the necessary nutrients for healthy growth. Alternatively,a
                    high-quality organic potting mixed is used in Udachwadiâ€™s farming.

                </ul>
                <p>Anjir is typically propagated through cuttings. In Udachiwadi, farmers have adopted organic practices for fig
                    cultivation, including the use of organic fertilizers and natural pest
                    control methods.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>Given the semi-arid conditions, drip irrigation systems have been implemented to optimize water usage for fig cultivation. The use of farm ponds and rainwater harvesting systems ensures the availability of water
                    throughout the year.</p>

                <p>The main challenges in fig farming include pest
                    infestations, such as fig borer, and the need for careful pruning to
