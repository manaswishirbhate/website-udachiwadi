            <p>Sitaphal thrive in hot and dry climates .This
                makes them ideal for places like udachiwadi ,where the weather is
                warm and there are long period without rain. These trees can tolerate
                drought , meaning they can grow well even when water is scares.
                Sitaphal prefer sandy loam soil. This type of
                soil drains well, which is important for the roots of the trees. Good
                drainage helps prevent water from pooling around the roots, which
                can cause problems.

            apples. This method is cost-effective, making it suitable for small
            farms. Grafting is another method, but it is less common among
            local farmers.</p>

            <li class="bold-title text-primary">Irrigation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While custards apple trees can survive with little waters,
            they need some irrigation when they are young. Farmers in
            Udachiwadi water the plants carefully during their early growth.
            once the trees are established, they need less water. Many farmers
            use drip irrigation systems to water the trees efficiently during
            important growth stages.</p>

            crops healthy without relying on harmful chemicals.</p>
