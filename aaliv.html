            <p>Aaliv (Lepidium sativum) is typically ready for
                harvest about 2 to 3 weeks after planting. You can start harvesting
                the leaves once they reach around 4 to 6 inches in height. For the
                best flavor, it's best to harvest them before they start to flower.
                Simply snip the leaves off just above the soil line, and they can
                continue to grow for a second harvest if conditions are right.

        <p>Aaliv seeds grow best when they are sown directly into the
            garden., and the crop matures in 30-40 days.
           In Udachiwadi, Aaliv is grown during both the Kharif and Rabi
            seasons.</p>

        <p>Aaliv requires minimal water, and in many cases, farmers
            in Udachiwadi rely solely on rain-fed irrigation or minimal water
            from farm ponds.</p>

        <p>The short growing cycle of Aaliv means that farmers
            need to be cautious of sudden weather changes, which can affect the
            crop yield.</p>

                <p>Garden cress is considered a nutritious food,
                    which can help farmers sell it at higher prices in healthfocused
                    markets.It grows fastâ€”usually ready to eat in just 2-3 weeks.
                    This means farmers can harvest multiple times in one season,
                    boosting their income.</p>
