    <div class="bg-text fade-in show">These measures resulted in improved water availability, increased crop yields, and reduced seasonal migration, as farmers gained stable access to water. Despite challenges like infrastructure maintenance and funding constraints, solutions included leveraging government schemes such as MGNREGA and fostering community involvement. Future plans aim to scale water conservation efforts, expand infrastructure, promote crop diversification, and advance training in sustainable practices.
